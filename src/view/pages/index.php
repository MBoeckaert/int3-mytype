  <p class="creator__content">Clarendon was published in 1845 after Robert Besley, an employee
  of the fans street foundry since 1826, was made a partner in the
  Firm. Due to its popularity, Besley registered the typeface under
  Britainâ€™s Ornamental Designs Act of 1842. The patent expired
  Three years later and other foundries were quick to copy it.
  Clarendon is considered the first registered typeface.

    <p>Clarendon is an English Slab-Serif. The strokes are fairly heavy of thick and thin weight contrast rather than a unfiform stroke. Characters such as f, a, e, and g have a rounded serif, in which is based on the roman model unlike the rest which is based on the Egyptian bold style. However, the squared serif are not as thick as most of the Egyptian style but rather have subtle brackets. Because of the bracketed serifs and the contrast in weights, it becomes a "problem as stroke become thinner it limits how tight the typeface can go (Velazquez).</p>

  <div class="why__reasons">
    <p class="reasons__img">Here comes an img</p>
    <p class="reasons__n1">The Clarendon design was immediately after creation
    very  popular and rapidly copied by other foundries.
    Thanks to the blockain, the original can be easily found.</p>
    <p class="reasons__n2">Best known as the font of the lawless Wild West era. The
    crypto landscape is still in it's infancy and governments
    are still figuring out how they can regulate this space.</p>
    <p class="reasons__n3">Robberies & the gold rush were also characteristic for the
    Wild West. The same is happening with NFT's where big
    money goes around & many scammers are lurking around.</p>
